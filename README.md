**Koronba** is a self-hostable archiving tool for Adobe Flash content, similar to sites like swfchan. It has the ability to check for duplicates and assign seen filenames, group Flash content by tags and much more!

# Usage

To run the project, run the **Koronba.Web** front-end project. Koronba itself doesn't depend on the MVC web front-end and can be safely used outside of it, by referencing the **Koronba.Core** project.
